**Project Theme:** The Friction We Forget (Clash-A-Thon 2026)
**Category:** HealthTech / Hyperlocal Reverse-Marketplace

## 1. Business Model Canvas (BMC)

| **Key Partnerships** | **Key Activities** | **Value Propositions** | **Customer Relationships** | **Customer Segments** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| • Local Chemists and Druggists Associations.<br>• Independent Polyclinics and Hospitals.<br>• Wholesale Pharma Distributors. | • Onboarding local pharmacies.<br>• Optimizing WebSocket latency for real-time pings.<br>• Data aggregation of "Missed Pings". | **For Patients:** Zero-friction medicine discovery in <60 seconds. End the physical "treasure hunt."<br><br>**For Pharmacies:** High-intent foot traffic delivered directly to the counter with zero inventory data-entry required. | • Automated, hyper-local matchmaking.<br>• Trust-building via AI/pharmacist-verified substitute suggestions.<br>• "Bhaichara" (Neighbor-to-Neighbor) network support. | **Primary:** Patients/caretakers needing rare or critical medicines urgently.<br><br>**Secondary:** Local retail pharmacies losing out to large e-commerce chains.<br><br>**Tertiary:** Wholesale distributors needing supply-chain data. |
| | **Key Resources** | | **Channels** | |
| | • Proprietary Geofencing Algorithm.<br>• Network of verified, active local pharmacies.<br>• Real-time WebSocket infrastructure. | | • QR Code standees at Hospital OPD exits.<br>• Prescribing doctors (word of mouth).<br>• Local Facebook/Viber community groups. | |

| **Cost Structure** | **Revenue Streams** |
| :--- | :--- |
| • Cloud Infrastructure (WebSockets, Database, Server hosting).<br>• SMS Gateway API (for offline fallback messages).<br>• Field sales & onboarding personnel (initial phase). | • **Micro-Lead Generation:** Pharmacies pay a small fee (e.g., Rs. 5–10) only when a patient successfully locks a reservation. (Pre-paid wallet model).<br>• **B2B Supply Chain Data:** Selling aggregated "FOMO Ledger" data (unmet demand heatmaps) to wholesale distributors. |

## 2. Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

Sanjeevani does not sell medicine; **we sell time and certainty.**

We are the only platform in Nepal that aggregates offline pharmacy inventory in real-time using **"Reverse-Broadcasting."** By asking pharmacies to respond with a single Voice Command ("Cha!"), we eliminate the massive friction of manual data entry that causes traditional digital health platforms to fail in rural and semi-urban Nepal.

### Competitor Comparison

| Feature | Sanjeevani | E-Commerce (e.g., Jeevee) | Manual (WhatsApp/Calls) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Instant Availability (< 2 mins)** | ✅ | ❌ (Takes 24-48 hours) | ❌ (Manual & slow) |
| **Zero Inventory Entry Required** | ✅ | ❌ (Requires full catalog) | ✅ |
| **Location-Based Matchmaking** | ✅ | ❌ (Centralized warehouse) | ❌ (Only known contacts) |
| **Emergency Triage Alerts** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

## 3. Revenue & Monetization Strategy

We avoid traditional "SaaS Subscriptions" which face high friction from small local shopkeepers. Instead, we use a hybrid performance and data-driven model:

### A. The Micro-Lead Model (Immediate Revenue)
Pharmacies load a prepaid wallet (via eSewa/Khalti). They are not charged a monthly fee. They are only charged a micro-fee (Rs. 5 - Rs. 10) when a patient clicks "Reserve & Navigate" for a ping they accepted. They pay strictly for guaranteed, high-intent foot traffic.

### B. The B2B Data Oracle (Scale & Profitability)
Through our **FOMO Ledger**, we track "Missed Pings" (e.g., 50 people searched for Dengue Kits, but no pharmacy accepted). We aggregate this completely anonymized data—fully compliant with Nepal’s Privacy Act 2075—and sell real-time supply-and-demand heatmaps to wholesale pharmaceutical distributors. This allows them to proactively restock specific neighborhoods before shopkeepers even place an order.

## 4. Market Analysis & Go-to-Market

*   **Total Addressable Market (TAM):** 20,000+ registered retail pharmacies in Nepal.
*   **Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM - Year 1):** 500+ pharmacies in the Koshi Province corridor (Itahari-Dharan-Biratnagar).
*   **Go-to-Market Strategy (First 100 Users):** The "Hospital Halo" Strategy. We will geofence a 1km radius around a single major hospital in Itahari. We manually onboard the 15 pharmacies in that circle with free wallet credits. We place a banner at the hospital gate: *"Medicine out of stock? Scan here to find it locally."*

## 5. Sustainability & Future Scope

*   **6-Month Vision:** Dominate the Itahari-Dharan medical corridor, establishing consistent daily active usage among chronic patients and achieving operational stability.
*   **1-Year Vision:** Expand into the Kathmandu Valley. Integrate directly with wholesale supply chain ERP systems to auto-order medicines based on our missed-ping analytics.
*   **Future Features:** 
    *   **Chyatteko Pata (The Cut-Strip Ledger):** Allowing patients to digitize and track the expiry dates of partial foil strips.
    *   **Bhaichara Network:** Enabling pharmacies to forward pings to neighboring shops to share the lead fee and preserve the customer relationship.
